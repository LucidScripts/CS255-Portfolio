# CS255-Portfolio
A portfolio project for CS255.

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was for a client who wanted a system to help students prepare for their driving tests. The goal was to design a platform that allowed students to take online lessons, schedule in-person training with instructors, and track their progress. The system also needed to stay in sync with DMV updates and give admins and instructors the tools to manage users, lessons, and reports.

#### What did you do particularly well?

I think I did especially well at breaking down the system requirements and translating them into clear diagrams. The use case and activity diagrams show exactly how each part of the system connects, and I made sure the roles, like student, admin, instructor, and DMV were clearly represented. That helped make the design easy to follow.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part, I’d improve the class diagram. I’d go a little deeper into the data relationships and show more details about how lessons, users, and reports interact. I believe that would make the technical structure even clearer and closer to what a developer could actually build from.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When interpreting the user’s needs, I focused on what each role needed to accomplish in the system. For example, students wanted convenience and progress tracking, instructors needed scheduling and note tools, and the owner needed reports and payment tracking. I feel that it’s important to build around those needs because the system only works if it actually solves the real problems the users have.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I like to start by mapping out what the user does and what the system should do in response. I use diagrams and user stories to visualize the flow, then refine the design from there. Going forward, I’d keep using an iterative approach, by getting feedback early, adjusting as I go, and keeping the focus on usability and functionality.
